Dense 3D Scene Reconstruction:
I have developed a pipeline for dense point cloud representation from multi-view RGB and depth images, incorporating camera calibration, distortion correction, and feature matching for accurate 3D scene modeling. Optimized transformations and data processing for efficient, generalizable reconstruction in under 2 minutes.
